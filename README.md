# Hostages fate prediction
This project is devoted for understanding terrorism events. Concretely, we focus on predicting the risk of losing hostages lives on a terrorism attack.
We start by introducing a new Dataset so called Risk of Losing Hostages Lives Database (RLHLD) in an effort to increase understanding of hostage taking attacks so that it can be more readily studied and defeated. The project includes also a KDD model to predict the probability of losing hostages.
> # Risk of losing hostages lives (Data)
Risk of Losing Hostages Lives Database (RLHLD) is an open-source database including information on hostage taking attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017 (with additional annual updates planned for the future). The database is inspired from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) see https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/
