# Hostages fate prediction
This project is devoted for understanding terrorism events. Concretely, we focus on predicting the risk of losing hostages lives on a terrorism attack.
We start by introducing a new Dataset so called Risk of Losing Hostages Lives (RLHL). The project includes also a KDD model to predict the probability of 
losing hostages.
